# Analysis of Flight Delays Across America in 2023
## Visualizing Delay Patterns by Various Factors to Reveal Flight Delay Trends

### INTRODUCTION
Flight delays are a common frustration for travellers, with patterns often influenced by a combination of factors such as time of day, seasonality, weather, and airline-specific policies. The goal of this project is to analyze flight delay data across the United States in 2023 to uncover meaningful trends.

By visualizing delays based on key metrics like hour of the day, month, and airline and various causes of delay, this web application enables users to explore delay patterns and better understand what drives these delays.

### DATA SOURCE AND OPERATIONS
The data was extracted from [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/). The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure the accuracy of analysis. This included the removal of irrelevant columns and handling of missing data. The analysis focuses on key metrics like departure delays, number of flights, and airline-specific performance.

All visualizations were created using Python libraries such as Plotly and Pandas, enabling an interactive exploration of delay patterns.

### FUTURE WORK
I would like to incorporate predictive modelling, which could help forecast delays based on historical data, providing even greater utility for travellers and airlines.
